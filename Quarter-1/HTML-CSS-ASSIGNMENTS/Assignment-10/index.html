  <P>
    Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intellegence and Computing is a privately funded 
    not-for-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, 
    Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities 
    in emerging tech fields like <br>

    </ul>
  </P>
  <h2 id="CNC" >Cloud Native Computing</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong> Cloud Native Computing </strong> program prepares the students to program in open source technologies 
    like <strong>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</strong>  while introducing the 
    students to development of Microservices and softwares development technique on cloud platforms like AWS. 
  </p>
  <h2  id="AI">
    Artificial Intelligence 
  </h2>
  <p>
    The <strong> Artificial Intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of AI technology, via teaching
    programming in open source languages like <strong>Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2,0 and Flask,</strong> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions 
    and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.  
  </p>
  <h2  id="Blockchain">Blockchain</h2>
  <p>
    The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is understand the blockchains like <strong>Ethereum and Hyperledger(Fabric),</strong>
    and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks ilke Node.js. This program also 
    introduces them to development of Distributed Apps(BApps), Framework like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding 
    of Blockchain-as-as-serivice (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an initial Coin Offering(ICO) of a crypto-token.
  </p>
  <h2 id="IoT">
    Internet of Things
  </h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>Internet of Things</strong> program introduces the students to open source development technologies like <strong>Rust, Embedded Rust, 
    WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</strong> while making them efficient in developing the Micro Services for IOT Edge,
    IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
