1. **React Foundation:**

# Prerequisite Knowledge:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# System Requirements:

- Node.js 20.12.0 or later.
- Operating systems: macOS, Windows, or Linux.
- VSCode or another text editor of your choice.

2. **React and Next.js Overview:**

# Next.js:

- Flexible React framework for creating fast, full-stack web applications.
- Provides essential building blocks for various application needs.

# Building Blocks of a Web Application:

1. User Interface: How users interact with your application.
2. Routing: Navigation between different parts of your application.
3. Data Fetching: Where your data is stored and how to retrieve it.
4. Rendering: When and where to render static or dynamic content.
5. Integrations: Connecting to third-party services (CMS, authentication, payments, etc.).
6. Infrastructure: Deployment, storage, and running of application code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc.).
7. Performance: Optimizing the application for end-users.
8. Scalability: Adapting as your team, data, and traffic grow.
9. Developer Experience: Building and maintaining the application.

# React:

- JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces (UI).
- Provides helpful functions (APIs) to build UI.
- Unopinionated about other aspects of building applications.
- Flourishing ecosystem of third-party tools and solutions, including Next.js.
- Requires effort to configure tools and solutions for common application needs.

# Next.js:

- React framework that handles tooling and configuration.
- Provides additional structure, features, and optimizations.
- Supports routing, data fetching, and caching.
- Improves developer and end-user experience.
- Suitable for individual developers and larger teams.
- Enables building fully interactive, dynamic, and performant web applications.

3. **Rendering User Interface:**

# How Browsers Render UI:

1. User Visits Web Page: Server sends an HTML file to the browser.
2. HTML to DOM: Browser reads HTML and creates the Document Object Model (DOM).

# What is the DOM?

- Object Representation: DOM is an object version of HTML elements.
- Bridge: Connects your code to the user interface.
- Tree Structure: Has parent and child relationships.

# DOM Manipulation:

- Methods and JavaScript: Use these to listen to user events and change the DOM.
- Select, Add, Update, Delete: Modify specific elements in the UI.
- Change Style and Content: Adjust the appearance and information of elements.
